<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina.  I graduated from Manteo High School and went on to attend Auburn University.  I am currently working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.  From an early age I knew that I wanted to work with computers and technology for the rest of my life.  Everything about technology facinates me and after attending a technology middle school on the Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University I knew that my true passion was technology.</p>

<p>After graduating High School, I received many scholarships including the Outer Banks of North Carolina Community Service foundation
scholarship as well as the National Science Foundation Scholarship.  I was the only undergraduate at Auburn University to receive this prodominately graduate level student awarded scholarship.  I have been involved on many things on campus including being a Director of 
the Freshman Leadership Programs as well as my involvement in Greek Organizations and philanthropy events.</p>

<p>Upon receiving my degree from Auburn University I have many goals for my life.  I want to work on a team of Software Engineers,
to solve problems of various different backgrounds.  Working on a team brings a lot of joy to me because I love collaborating with
others to come up with great solutions that may not be possible with the mind of only one.  Eventually, I would love to attain a 
management position in a company that has the same work ethic as I already described.  Being in charge of a team of these engineers
would allow me to oversee that problems are solved and projects are completed on a timely manner.</p>

Global Effects of Technology</h3>

<p>This article has divided the discussion of the Global Effects of Technology into 4 categories: Conquering Language Barriers,
Transforming Global Commerce, Methods of Conducting Business and Establishing Personal Connections.</p>

<p>In the first topic of Conquering Language Barriers discusses how with the computing power of smart phones and having 
technology more accessible to a large group of people, this in turn means that more and more people have the ability to 
communicate fluently with one another.  With many services like Google Translate becoming more and more popular it allows 
people to translate what they want to say intomany different languages and also recieve a message in a different language 
with that of which you are familiar with and translate it into your native language. </p>

<p>Another area of our lives that technology is having a huge impact on is the way we buy and sell goods.  Technology has 
allowed for e-commerce to boom in popularity.  The important thing that we must know as consumers is to keep the competition 
fair between online purchases and local store purchases.  It is our duty as consumers to ensure that technology doesn't
entirely get rid of the way we buy and sell goods in person as well.  Technology should help us as people not cause more problems.
Technology is also having a huge impact on the way we conduct business with one another.  With services like Skype and GoToMeeting,
it is giving us opportunities to attend board meetings and conference calls while presenting our info to a large group of people 
that do not have to be in the same room as one another.  This is a huge impact because it allows people to communicate easier with 
people they may not normally talk to due to constraints of distance. </p>

<p>Finally, the author discusses the problems that technology is creating on the establishment of personal connections.
Technology is causing many humans to lose their social skills, there is a different set of skills for being able to talk 
to a person face to face versus being able to communicate through words over a text or email.  If we continue to rely 
only on communication through technology then we will eventually lose our face to face communication skills, therefore 
hurting the human race and causing us to be entirely technology dependent.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p> -->
